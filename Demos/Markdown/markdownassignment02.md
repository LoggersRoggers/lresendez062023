# Levels of Diction
In all forms of literature - nonfiction, fiction, poetry and drama - authors choose particular words to convey effect and meaning to the reader. Writers employ diction, or word choice, to communicate ideas and impressions, to evoke emotions and to convey their view of truth to the reader. The following definitions may be useful in helping to understand and appreciate the deliberate word choices that writers make.

1. High or Formal Diction usually contains language that creates and elevates tones. It is free of slang, idioms, colloquialisms, and contractions. It often contains polysyllabic words, sophisticated syntax, and elegant word choice.
1. Neutral Diction uses standard language and vocabulary without elaborate words and many include contractions.
1. Informal or Low Diction is the language of everyday use. It is relaxed and conversational. It often oncludes common and simple words, idioms, slang, jargon and contractions.
## Types of Diction
* Slang refers to a group of recently coined words often used in informal situations.
* Colloquial expressions are nonstandard, often regional, ways of using language appropiate to informal or conversational speech and writing.
* Jargon consists of words and expressions characteristic of a particular profession, or pursuit.
* Dialect is a nonstandard subgroup of a language with its own vocabulary and grammatical features.
* Concrete Diction consists of specific words that describe physical qualities or conditions.
* Abstract Diction refers to language that denotes ideas, emotions, conditions, or concepts that are intangible.
* Denoation is the exact, literal definition of a word independant of any emotional association or secondary.
* Connotation is the implicit rather than explicit meaning of a word and consists of the suggestions, associations, and emotional overtones attached to a word.
