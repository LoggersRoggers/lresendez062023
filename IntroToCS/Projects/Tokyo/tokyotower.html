				<h2>Tokyo Tower</h2>
				
<p>The orange and white steel beams of Tokyo Tower rise 1,092 feet (333 meters) above the city. See this landmark from many points across Tokyo then change perspectives and view the city from the tower’s observation decks.</p>

<p>The tower was built in 1958, just 13 years after much of Tokyo was devastated by World War II bombing. It was 69 years later and 28 feet (9 meters) taller than Paris’s Eiffel Tower, which provided inspiration for the structure. Its creation as the world’s tallest tower at the time symbolized Japan’s emerging economic powers. While the initial intent for the structure was service as a radio and television tower, it has hosted more than 150 million visitors since 1958.</p>

<p>At the base of the tower, in Foot Town, you will find a food court, wax museum, children’s amusement park, souvenir shop, and one of the world’s largest aquariums, with more than 50,000 fish of 900 species.</p>

<p>Take one of the express elevators from the first floor of Foot Town to the Main Observatory at 476 feet (145 meters). This level features a stage for live music, a cafeteria offering aerial city views, and “look-down” windows to view the structure and ground immediately below. For an additional fee, you can take another elevator to the Special Observatory for even more impressive 360-degree views. This is a good place to get your bearings before exploring the rest of the city.</p>

<p>To increase visitor traffic, tower lighting was increased and enhanced in 1989. One lighting strategy provides white lighting to create a cool effect in the summer and orange lighting for warmth in the winter in the early evening. Additional lights in seven colors create lighting for seasonal celebrations.
</p>
				
<p>Tokyo Tower is in the Minato district of southern Tokyo. Many bus routes, subway lines and the Tokyo monorail have stops within three to 15 minutes’ walk of Tokyo Tower. The nearest subway is Akabanebashi. There is also a paid parking lot next to the tower.</p>
